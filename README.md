- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shreyan-Bokka
- 👀 I’m interested in coding but this is like the first time ever investing a lot into coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of different things, I'm never really committed to one thing at one time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything.
- 📫 How to reach me just email me at my other primary email that I use for school: bokkas2024@fau.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can use nunchucks and I do tae kwon do.
